    "text": "In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package, containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data. Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects. This workshop assumes you’ve already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you’ve managed to create a basic package and pass R CMD check. In terms of “How to draw an owl,” you’ve definitely drawn some circles. But now it’s time to draw the rest of the owl!\nYou will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.\nThe exact topics won’t be finalized until closer to conf, but they are likely to be drawn from this list:\nIt is likely we will reserve a chunk of time late in the day for you to apply something you’ve learned to your own package(s). This is a good chance to talk things through with members of the tidyverse team. This will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will be using the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.\nThis course is for you if you:"

You will learn to create static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and htmlwidgets, or steer them in the direction of sophisticated scientific documents. In the afternoon you’ll take the same authoring approaches to create slide presentations in various formats such as reveal.js, beamer, and pptx.\nThis course is for you if you:\nSeasoned users of R Markdown will get more out of the Build-a-Dashboard Workshop (with Quarto, R and/or Python) or Quarto Websites workshops, which are focused on specific output types."

Additionally, with intelligent resizing of components, your Quarto Dashboards look great on devices of all sizes. And importantly, you can author Quarto Dashboards without leaving the comfort of your “home” – in plain text markdown with any text editor (VS Code, RStudio, Neovim, etc.) or any notebook editor (JupyterLab, etc.).\nThis workshop will walk you through building an increasingly complex dashboard using various layout options and deploy them as static web pages (with no special server required) as well as with a Shiny Server on the backend for enhanced interactivity.\nThis course is for you if you:"

    "text": "The R programming language provides powerful primitives for data visualization. In particular, for many data scientists the package ggplot2 is the go-to toolkit for making visualizations. Through its modular and extensible design, ggplot2 has mushroomed into a formidable ecosystem, and with the aid of third-party extension packages there is little in terms of data visualization that cannot be done with ggplot2 these days. However, harnessing this flexibility and power can present a steep learning curve. While most users can quickly throw together a scatter plot or histogram, turning the initial figure draft into a carefully designed, publication-ready visualization requires a much deeper understanding of how ggplot2 functions.\nThis workshop has two complementary goals. First, you will learn useful tips and tricks for ggplot2 that will help you make plots that look stylish, unique, and exactly the way you want them to. This will include strategies for layering geoms, customizing coordinate systems and scales, tweaking the plot theme and other aspects of the plot appearance, and creating annotations. Second, you will learn some fundamental principles of figure design. These will include principles for choosing color palettes and for designing for color-vision deficiency, as well as some general principles of communication and design for accessibility.\nThis course is for you if you:"

When writing a function you will learn how to deal with “data masking”, give default values to arguments, give unspecified arguments, and what side effects are and how to manage them.

Workshop examples will begin with simple, intuitive models (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, linear regression) but also demonstrate the use of more commonly used and industry standard models (e.g., L1 Regularized regression and Light Gradient Boosting Machines).

    "text": "The gt package for R and the Great Tables package for Python both deal with an important element of written communication: tables. We don’t believe tables have to be drab or dull. Rather, we think that tables have the power to inspire and to excite!\nIn this workshop, you’ll learn about how to make tables that can accurately convey information yet look aesthetically pleasing. We will handle the first stumbling block: what do we even call the different parts of a table? After getting the table terminology down we’ll learn how to effectively assemble the table components and create powerful displays of information. We will start simply and progressively, working toward more complex table designs. Since there are two packages (one in R, one in Python) we will take a blended approach and learn about table generation in bilingual fashion.\nWe’ll cover the following:\n\nCreate table components and put them together (e.g., header, footer, stub, etc.)\nFormat cell values (numeric/scientific, date/datetime, etc.)\nRearranging columns and handling column value alignments\nStyling the table, either through data values or on a more granular level\nAdding icons, plots, images, and incorporating your own HTML more!\n\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nhave some basic working knowledge of either R or Python (separate sets of materials will be available for both R and Python),\nhave data you often need to present as data summaries\nwould like to level-up your ability to generate tables for publication"

We are offering this as part of our “Posit Academy + Workshop Pass,” available for purchase during registration.\nThis is not a standard workshop, but a six-week, online Posit Academy apprenticeship followed by a one-day, in-person learning experience at posit::conf(2024).\nHere, you will learn the foundations of R for data science together with a close group of fellow learners, under the guidance of a Posit Academy mentor. Topics will include the basics of R, importing data, visualizing and wrangling data with the tidyverse, and reporting reproducibly with Quarto.\nOnline Experience (July 1st - August 9th) You will be expected to complete a weekly curriculum of interactive tutorials and an applied data science project. You will attend two weekly meetings with your mentor and fellow learners via Zoom to work together, ask questions, and share your work with your group. Visit posit.co/academy to learn more about this uniquely effective learning format.\nIn-person experience (August 12th) You will join your fellow learners at posit::conf(2024) to practice, apply and extend what you have learned through a series of group coding challenges, led by Posit Academy staff.\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nare new to R or the tidyverse,\nhave dabbled in R, but now want a rigorous foundation in up-to-date data science best practices, or\nare a SAS or Excel user looking to switch your workflows to R."
