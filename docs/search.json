    "text": "The R programming language provides powerful primitives for data visualization. In particular, for many data scientists the package ggplot2 is the go-to toolkit for making visualizations. Through its modular and extensible design, ggplot2 has mushroomed into a formidable ecosystem, and with the aid of third-party extension packages there is little in terms of data visualization that cannot be done with ggplot2 these days. However, harnessing this flexibility and power can present a steep learning curve. While most users can quickly throw together a scatter plot or histogram, turning the initial figure draft into a carefully designed, publication-ready visualization requires a much deeper understanding of how ggplot2 functions.\nThis workshop has two complementary goals. First, you will learn useful tips and tricks for ggplot2 that will help you make plots that look stylish, unique, and exactly the way you want them to. This will include strategies for layering geoms, customizing coordinate systems and scales, tweaking the plot theme and other aspects of the plot appearance, and creating annotations. Second, you will learn some fundamental principles of figure design. These will include principles for choosing color palettes and for designing for color-vision deficiency, as well as some general principles of communication and design for accessibility.\nThis course is for you if you:"

You will learn the two main ways to reduce duplication: creating functions and using iteration.\nWe will use a tidyverse approach to cover function design and iteration. When writing a function you will learn how to deal with “data masking”, give default values to arguments, give unspecified arguments, and what side effects are and how to manage them. In the afternoon, you will learn how to iterate across the columns of a dataframe using across(), what “anonymous” functions are and how to read and write multiple files using purrr.\nThis course is for you if you:"

You will be introduced to best practices for machine learning model creation and selection, including data splitting, pre-processing, parameter and model optimization, as well as results visualization and communication. Workshop examples will begin with simple, intuitive models (e.g., K-nearest neighbors, linear regression) but also demonstrate the use of more commonly used and industry standard models (e.g., L1 Regularized regression and Light Gradient Boosting Machines). The workshop will focus on demonstrating how to do this using the modern Scikit-learn pipeline syntax.\nThis course is for you if you:\nIntermediate or expert familiarity with modeling or machine learning is not required."

Rather, we think that tables have the power to inspire and to excite!\nIn this workshop, you’ll learn about how to make tables that can accurately convey information yet look aesthetically pleasing. We will handle the first stumbling block: what do we even call the different parts of a table? After getting the table terminology down we’ll learn how to effectively assemble the table components and create powerful displays of information. We will start simply and progressively, working toward more complex table designs. Since there are two packages (one in R, one in Python) we will take a blended approach and learn about table generation in bilingual fashion.\nWe’ll cover the following:\n\nCreate table components and put them together (e.g., header, footer, stub, etc.)\nFormat cell values (numeric/scientific, date/datetime, etc.)\nRearranging columns and handling column value alignments\nStyling the table, either through data values or on a more granular level\nAdding icons, plots, images, and incorporating your own HTML more!\n\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nhave some basic working knowledge of either R or Python (separate sets of materials will be available for both R and Python),\nhave data you often need to present as data summaries\nwould like to level-up your ability to generate tables for publication"
