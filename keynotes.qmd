### Practical Tips for using Generative AI in Data Science Workflows

```markdown
Tuesday, Aug 13 4:15 PM - 5:15 PM PDT
```

:::{.callout-tip}

## Keynote Info
* Presenter: Melissa Van Bussel
* [[Slides](https://github.com/melissavanbussel/posit-conf-2024/blob/main/slides.pdf) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/melissavanbussel/posit-conf-2024)]

:::

* [GPT 4.o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o) has great image processing capabilities
* Math
  + Example: Processing a math equation written on paper into Quarto code
    + *Prompt: Convert the text in the image into a Quarto document, using `format: html` and keep the same text formatting (bold, italic, underline, etc.)*
    + *Prompt: Convert the text in the image into a Quarto document, using `format: html`, and use styling to make sure that the font styles (e.g., bold, italic) and colors match the image, where possible. Align the math around the equals signs.*
      + Also asking it to add styling to match pen colors

![](images/AI_math_quarto_conversion.png)

* Data entry
  + *Prompt: Convert the table in the image into a downloadable CSV.*
    + Shows you an interactive preview of the dataset; can also modify it on the fly (e.g., highlight different columns/cells, provide data cleaning/formatting instructions)
  + *Prompt: Simulate additional observations so that there are 1000 rows. Create two additional variables, "Years of Experience" and "Education level." Ensure that the generated information and salaries are realistic.*
  + *Prompt: Provide a short overview of the dataset, including the data types for each variable.*
  + *Prompt: Provide summary statistics.*
  + *Prompt: Analyze the dataset and extract interesting facts. Use data storytelling techniques to weave together a short (75 word) paragraph that pulls together key insights.*
* Analysis
  + *Prompt: Create a data visualization using the salaries dataset. Put average salary on the y-axis and job role on the x-axis. Use a different color for each job role. Create a bar chart that's faceted by the industry variable. Add a horizontal black line showing the average salary for each industry. Format the y-axis as dollar amounts. Use a modern color palette and a minimal theme. Display a legend on the right.*
    + Write prompt to be consistent with the grammar of graphics
    + Will show you code and graph (you can now run Python code directly within chat)
* Creating slides using Quarto themes
  + GitHub Pages / GitLab Pages to host a Quarto project
    + [Generative AI Quarto Theme Generator Shiny App](https://melissavanbussel.shinyapps.io/quarto_theme_generator/)
* Creating a logo for a hex sticker
  + Transparent background, scaled easily without becoming pixelated
  + Text to svg generators
    + Example: [Recraft AI](https://www.recraft.ai)
    + Text prompt and specify height, width, color palette, how simple/detailed, art styles
    + Generate mock-ups
* Two tools that use Generative AI to make teaching and communicating about data easier
  + [Scribe](https://scribehow.com/): Automatically create step-by-step tutorials without copy-pasting screenshots or recording videos
    + Scribe Chrome extension to create automatic screenshots/instructions (e.g., where you clicked will be highlighted)
    + Can share it for free (direct link or by email)
    + Can embed as an iframe, for example, on a Quarto website
    + Pro-subscription for desktop version of Scribe; can export in variety of formats (including Markdown)
  + [descript](https://www.descript.com): Edit videos and audio/podcasts as if you're editing a Word document
    + Upload video/audio file and it will be transcribed (available in over 20 different language)
    + Once the transcript is ready, you can edit the transcript in order to edit the video itself
    + Can remove awkward silences (shorten word gaps) and remove filler words
    + AI speech generation capabilities
      + Regenerate: You can use your voice clone to regenerate content
      + Overdub: You can use to replace wordings
    + Other AI features
      + Eye contact
      + Remove retakes
      + YouTube descriptions: from your transcript, descript will generate a YouTube-style description and provide timestamps for sections
* Guidelines for responsible use

  + Slope of enlightenment
  + Plateau of productivity
* Slope of enlightenment
  + Two things that make me optimistic
    + Improving data literacy
    + More and more available data
  + One that makes me worry
    + Excessive consumption of relentless negative media
